FIREBASE FIRESTORE CLEANUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

To show only the 2 authenticated users in your app:

1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project "secure"
3. Click "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
4. Click on the "users" collection
5. Look for users that don't have matching emails in Authentication page
6. Delete those user documents (the ones that are NOT in Authentication)

The 2 users that SHOULD stay (from Authentication page):
- luohino.pinsry@gmail.com
- aniketsingh821305@gmail.com

DELETE any other user documents from Firestore that are NOT in the list above.

IMPORTANT: Only delete from Firestore "users" collection, NOT from Authentication!

Alternative: If you want me to add code to auto-cleanup on app start, I can do that too.
